## Overview

The project is designed to sort the Skittles candy according to their color: orange, green, purple and yellow.
Candy goes down on a plastic tube. A candy is picked up by a rotating platform powered by the servomotor. This brings the candy to the color sensor. After the sensor recognizes the color, the slider driven by the second servomotor is rotated depending on the color of the candy. When the slide is in place, the platform moves, leaving the candy to fall.
